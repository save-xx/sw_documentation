# Create a new simulation

Previous: [To install](installation)

## Setup

In order to create a new simulation is recommended to create a dedicated folder (separate from the installation folder, is installed from Source).

For this example we will call it mysim

```bash 
mkdir mysim && cd mysim
```

Within the folder run the following shortcut:
```bash
SwarmSwIM create_new
```

Should output:
```
$ Initiated SwarmSwIM env templates in .
```

In windows or some python Env it ma be possible that the shortcut does not work, you can still refer to the script by running:

```bash
python3 -m SwarmSwIM.utility.cli create_new
```

Test by running the automatically created example:
```bash
python3 example.py
```

---

## Create a new script
We will ignore `example.py` and create a brand new script to run our simulation
Create a new file `my_first_sim.py`

```python
# Import the Simulator
from SwarmSwIM import Simulator

PERIOD = 0.05 

# Start a Simulator instance with a 0.05 s period
S = Simulator(PERIOD)

# Execute 100 simulation steps (5 seconds)
for i in range(100):
    # run a simulation step
    events = S.tick()
    # print step events
    print(events)
```

This is the most basic simulation. 

```python 
S = Simulator(PERIOD)
```
Starts a new simulation object with a certain timestep (mandatory field). By default the `Simulator` will search for `simualtion.xml` in the script folder. the user can specify a specific `sim_xml` as a path (either relative or absolute) to specify a different xml file to be used. Details of the `Simulator` class are in [Simulator](Simulator).

```python 
events = S.tick()
```

Advances the simulation forward of one period. events is a dictionary collecting all plugins events. Currenty no plugin has been added, as such the event dictionary is empty.
